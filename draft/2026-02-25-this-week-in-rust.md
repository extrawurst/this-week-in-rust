### Miscellaneous

## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [docstr](https://github.com/nik-rev/docstr), a macro crate providing a macro to create multiline strings out of doc comments.

Thanks to [Nik Revenco](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1557) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

*No calls for testing were issued this week by
[Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
[Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
[Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen) or
[Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Overall, a bit more noise than usual this week, but mostly a slight improvement
with several low-level optimizations at MIR and LLVM IR building landing. Also
less commits landing than usual, mostly due to GitHub CI issues during the week.

Triage done by **@simulacrum**.
Revision range: [3c9faa0d..eeb94be7](https://perf.rust-lang.org/?start=3c9faa0d037b9eecda4a440cc482ff7f960fb8a5&end=eeb94be79adc9df7a09ad0b2421f16e60e6d932c&absolute=false&stat=instructions%3Au)

3 Regressions, 4 Improvements, 4 Mixed; 3 of them in rollups
24 artifact comparisons made in total
