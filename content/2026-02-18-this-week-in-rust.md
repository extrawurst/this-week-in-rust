## Crate of the Week

This week's crate is [banish](https://github.com/LoganFlaherty/banish), a proc macro to build rule-driven state machines using a declarative DSL.

Thanks to [Logan Flaherty](https://users.rust-lang.org/t/crate-of-the-week/2704/1547) for the self-suggestion!

[Please submit your suggestions and votes for next week][submit_crate]!

## Calls for Testing
An important step for RFC implementation is for people to experiment with the
implementation and give feedback, especially before stabilization.

If you are a feature implementer and would like your RFC to appear in this list, add a
`call-for-testing` label to your RFC along with a comment providing testing instructions and/or
guidance on which aspect(s) of the feature need testing.

*No calls for testing were issued this week by
  [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
  [Cargo](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen),
  [Rustup](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustup/issues?q=state%3Aopen%20label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen) or
  [Rust language RFCs](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/issues?q=label%3Acall-for-testing%20state%3Aopen).*

[Let us know](https://github.com/rust-lang/this-week-in-rust/issues) if you would like your feature to be tracked as a part of this list.

### Rust Compiler Performance Triage

Several pull requests introduced (usually very small) regressions across the board this week. On the
other hand, [#151380](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/151380) provided a nice performance win in the inference engine.
I would also like to bring attention to [#152375](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/152375),
which improved the parallel frontend. It is not shown in this report, because we don't yet have
many benchmarks for the parallel frontend, but this PR seemingly improved the `check` (wall-time)
performance with multiple frontend threads on several real-world crates by 5-10%!

Triage done by **@kobzol**.

# Quote of the Week

> Clearly there is such a thing as too much syntactic sugar (as one of my professors put it, "syntactic sugar causes semantic cancer"), but at the same time also clearly some syntactic sugar is worth having.
